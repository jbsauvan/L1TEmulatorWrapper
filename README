https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideL1TOfflineDev 
Then clone the repository: 
> git clone git@github.com:jbsauvan/L1TEmulatorWrapper.git L1TEmulatorWrapper
> cd L1TEmulatorWrapper
Finally compile the wrapper library. Make sure you have done cmsenv before compiling, otherwise it won't find the CMSSW emulator headers and libraries.
> make
The library is created in lib/
